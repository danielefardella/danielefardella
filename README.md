Hi, I’m @danielefardella,
I’m interested in cybersecurity, and I’m currently graduating in Computer Science at "La Sapienza" University of Rome, 
I’m looking for an internship in cybersecurity, quantum computing, Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, possibly in Rome, Italy.
Here you can view some of the projects I've been working on during my studies.
